Division Algorithm Application
==============================

## John Harvey

### About
Basic C program that takes an unsigned int and uses the division algorithm to convert to decimal, hex, and IP formats. The unsigned int used to test is 0xFACECAFE.

### Install Notes
1. Clone repo with git `git clone https://github.com/jharvey7136/division_algorithm.git`
2. Navigate to app's root directory through terminal
3. Compile with command: `make`
4. Run with command: `make run`
5. Clean object file and executable: `make clean`

### Output
int TestValue = 0xFACECAFE  
```
Division Algorithm
Your Value: 4207856382 decimal
